An early stage Javascript image-uploading library design to work with SWFUpload.  Rainydays will flexibly handle individual file uploads as well as uploading and manipulating albums, and will provide unit tests.  

Note: while the individual scripts do work (we're using them in several sites), I need to do a lot of work to clean up unnecessary files (placeholder, requiredfield, and autocomplete will be factored out) and provide a consistent and documented interface.
