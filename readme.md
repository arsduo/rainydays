Rainydays
====
Rainydays (<a href="http://github.com/arsduo/rainydays" target="_blank">http://github.com/arsduo/rainydays</a>) is a Javascript library for file uploads, with support for uploading entire albums as well as individual files using the SWFUpload library.  

You can check out a demo of Rainydays in action at <a href="http://demos.alexkoppel.com/rainydays/demo" target="_blank">http://demos.alexkoppel.com/rainydays/demo</a>.  

N.B.: Rainydays started out as a "My First Open-Source Project", and as such still needs both documentation and some refactoring.  Future goals also include support for the native drag & drop and file upload APIs.
